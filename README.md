InboxRecyclerView is a library for building expandable descendant navigation, inspired by [Google Inbox](http://androidniceties.tumblr.com/post/100872004063/inbox-by-gmail-google-play-link) and [Reply](https://material.io/design/material-studies/reply.html). If you're interested in learning how it was created, [here's a detailed blog post](https://saket.me/inbox-recyclerview).

```groovy
implementation 'me.saket:inboxrecyclerview:1.0.0-beta3'
```

FYI, `InboxRecyclerView` has a dependency on `androidx`. If you haven't [migrated](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/05/hello-world-androidx.html) from the support library already, this would be a good opportunity.

### Usage

`InboxRecyclerView` can be dropped in existing projects without requiring any effort. You can take a look at the [sample app](https://github.com/saket/InboxRecyclerView/tree/master/sample) for best practices or [download its APK](https://github.com/saket/InboxRecyclerView/releases) for trying it out on your phone.

**Layout**

```xml
<me.saket.inboxrecyclerview.InboxRecyclerView
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="match_parent" />

<!--
  This is where your expandable content will be present. One
  way of using it would be to add a Fragment inside the layout
  and update it when any list item is clicked.

  It's recommended that the content page has a higher z-index
  than the list. This can be achieved by either giving it a
  higher view position or a higher elevation.
-->
<me.saket.inboxrecyclerview.page.ExpandablePageLayout
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="match_parent" />
```

**Expanding content**

```java
recyclerView.setExpandablePage(contentPage)

recyclerViewAdapter.itemClickListener = { clickedItem ->
  expandableFragment.loadContent(clickedItem)
  recyclerView.expandItem(clickedItem.adapterId)
}
```

### How do I…

- [customize item expand animations?](https://github.com/saket/InboxRecyclerView/wiki/Item-animations)
- [control the pull-to-collapse gesture?](https://github.com/saket/InboxRecyclerView/wiki/Pull-to-collapse)
- [change the background tint?](https://github.com/saket/InboxRecyclerView/wiki/Background-tint)
- [listen to state changes?](https://github.com/saket/InboxRecyclerView/wiki/Page-callbacks)

### Pull collapsible activities

To maintain consistency across the whole app, this library also includes a `PullCollapsibleActivity` that brings the same animations and gesture to activities with little effort.

Step 1. Extend `PullCollapsibleActivity`.

Step 2. Add these attributes to the activity’s theme:

```xml
<item name=“android:windowIsTranslucent”>true</item>
<item name=“android:colorBackgroundCacheHint”>@null</item>
```
